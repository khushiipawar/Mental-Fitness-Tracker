# Mental-Fitness-Tracker
This Python script performs a simple machine learning task on a dataset related to mental health. Let's go through the code step-by-step to understand what it does:
Importing Libraries: The script imports necessary Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib for data analysis, visualization, and modeling.
Importing Data: The script reads the dataset from a CSV file named "mental-and-substance dataset.csv" using pandas' read_csv function and assigns it to the variable data. It then prints "Importing Data is successfully done" to indicate that the data has been imported.
Checking Imported Data: The script prints the first 10 rows of the dataset using data.head(10) to check if the data has been imported correctly.
Handling Missing Values: The script checks for missing values in the dataset using data.isnull().sum(). It appears that the "Code" column has missing values (690 missing values).
Dropping Columns: The script drops the "Code" column using data.drop('Code',axis=1 , inplace=True) since it contains many missing values and may not be useful for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The script performs a correlation analysis on the remaining columns using a heatmap generated by sns.heatmap(data.corr(),annot=True,cmap='Blues'). It helps to visualize the pairwise correlations between numeric variables.
Data Preprocessing: The script prepares the data for modeling by converting categorical variables to numerical values using LabelEncoder from sklearn.preprocessing. It assigns the independent features to X and the target variable to y.
Data Splitting: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split from the sklearn.model_selection module.
Linear Regression Model: The script trains a linear regression model using LinearRegression from the sklearn.linear_model module. It evaluates the model's performance on both the training and testing sets by calculating Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) values.
Random Forest Regression Model: The script also trains a Random Forest regression model using RandomForestRegressor from the sklearn.ensemble module. Similarly, it evaluates the model's performance on both the training and testing sets.
The output of the script provides the performance metrics of both the Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression models on the training and testing sets. The Random Forest model seems to perform better than the Linear Regression model, as it achieves much lower MSE and RMSE values and higher R2 scores on the testing set, indicating better predictive performance. The code mainly focuses on regression tasks to predict the "DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) - Mental disorders - Sex: Both - Age: All Ages (Percent)" based on other features in the dataset.
